SpookLuke is a private company app that I built and launched as a freelance developer for SpookLuke Ventures LLC.

SpookLuke Ventures LLC is a coaching business where they train their clients in a video game called Rocket League. Their clients follow a training program and the app serves as a progression and data tracker for the purpose of aiding and motivating the trainees throughout their journey. 

The app was built with Swift and UIKit and includes features such as:

- Daily accountability trackers (using UITableView with custom xib cells)
- Preset training routine timers with notifications
- Automated day-by-day walkthrough of the program
- Personalized data tracking (saved persistently with Realm)
- Trend graphs of user game data (genereated with Charts API)
